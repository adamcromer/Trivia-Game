The goal of this project was to create a trivia game based around the classic movie 'The Big Lebowski'. User gets asked one question at a time with four possible answers. If they don't answer within ten seconds then it gets marked as a wrong answer. 

After answering all ten questions it will show you how many out of ten you answered correctly.

This project was made using JQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Have fun!
